<h1>WebPasswordSafe User Guide</h1>

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>
WebPasswordSafe is an open-source, web-based secure password safe for the enterprise that supports multiple users with delegated 
access controls. Simple to use, you can manage passwords and other sensitive secrets centrally in a secure database with industry standard 
strong encryption. Fine-grained access controls can be defined on passwords to share with other authorized users in view only, view and 
update, or delegated granting modes. Reusable permission templates can be defined. Ability to organize passwords using friendly tags. 
Configurable strong password generation tool. Full audit trail of all password access events, many useful and configurable reports, 
as well as pluggable modules for external logging all audit events. History of old passwords can be kept. Exports can be done for disaster 
recovery purposes. Password retrieval also exposed via Web Services for automated processes.
<br/><br/>
This user guide was written to cover the common default environment, however much of the power
of WebPasswordSafe comes through its ease of customization and integration into existing environments
so consult your system administrator for specific details especially in regard to authentication, roles, and authorization.
</p>

<h2>II. Basic Features</h2>

<h3>1. Login</h3>
<p>
Using your web-browser, go to the WebPasswordSafe URL.  Ask your system administrator how you should authenticate in your environment.
Enter your username and password and click the "Submit" button or press Enter.  If the login attempt fails you will get an error message
and need to try again. If it is successful the WebPasswordSafe main screen will load and show your name as "Logged In As" at the top right.
</p> 

<h3>2. Logout</h3>
<p>
To logout of WebPasswordSafe and end your current session, click on "User" in the main menu, then "Logout".
</p>

<h3>3. Change Your Authentication Password</h3>
<p>
To change the password you use to login (if using default WebPasswordSafe authentication), click on "User"
in the main menu, then "Settings", then "Change Password".  Type your new password in each of the text boxes
(they must match and not be blank) and click the "Okay" button.
</p>

<h3>4. Add Password</h3>
<p>
To add a new password into the system, click on "Password" in the main menu, then "New".  Enter the appropriate
information for this password and click the "Save" button.
</p>

<h4>i. Basic Password Information</h4>
<p>
Enter the "Title" as to how this password will be identified as (for instance "system - user").
Enter the "Username" for this password.  Enter the actual "Password" value for this entry if one 
already exists or you can click the "Generate Password" button to generate a new random password
that meets your environment's password strength complexity policy.  Optionally additional information
about this password entry can be stored in the "Notes" field (URL, vendor contact info, etc), 
however keep in mind this data is not encrypted.  
</p>

<h4>ii. Tags</h4>
<p>
"Tags" are one-word keywords or metadata terms that classify the password helping to organize them and allow
more efficient searching.  Separate multiple tags on the same line using blank space or commas.
</p>

<h4>iii. Password History</h4>
<p>
The "Max History" field can be changed to a number that represents the number of historical 
past passwords to store for this entry, or leave as the default of -1 which means keep infinite generations.
</p>

<h4>iv. Password Permissions</h4>
<p>
To apply the proper access control permissions for this password, click on the "Edit Permissions" button.
By default, passwords are initially created giving permission to the currently logged in user with GRANT access.
You may add additional permission rows by choosing a user or group from the "Select a User/Group" drop-down box
and clicking the "Add" button.  You can also begin typing a user/group name in the drop-down box to jump to
an entry that matches what you are typing.  Once a user/group permission row is added, you can adjust the access
level by selecting the appropriate value (READ/WRITE/GRANT) from the drop-down in that row of table.  You can
remove a row by selecting an entry and clicking the "Remove Selected" button.  You can remove all rows
from the table by clicking the "Remove All" button.  If you accidently alter permissions, click the "Cancel" button
and "Edit Permissions" again.  Once finished, click the "Okay" button to return to the Password window. 
</p>

<h4>v. Apply Permission Template</h4>
<p>
You can bulk add permissions to passwords by applying permission templates if templates have been created.
From the Permissions window, click the "Apply Template" button.  On the Templates window, select the template
name you want to apply and click the "Okay" button.  The permissions of that template will then be added to
the permissions table.
</p>

<h3>5. Search For Passwords</h3>
<p>
Searching for passwords is probably the most frequent activity when using WebPasswordSafe, and as such the
Password Search window is the default one displayed.  One can also clear and refresh this screen by
clicking on "Password" in the main menu, then "Search". 
</p>

<h4>i. Search Query</h4>
<p>
Enter a search query to filter results using term(s) associated with the password entries 
(including title, username, and notes)  you are looking for in the text box, 
using the '*' character for wildcards, or leave empty to return all passwords the logged in user 
has access to read.  Uncheck the "Active Only" checkbox to include disabled (deleted) passwords in your search.
Click the "Search" button to initiate a search and results will be returned in the table below.  Results can be
sorted using the column header controls of the table.
</p>

<h4>ii. Filter By Tags</h4>
<p>
Search queries can be further refined by selecting one or more "Tag(s)" from the checkboxes on the left
of the screen which will only return passwords with those tag(s) associated to them.  Multiple tags selected
are treated as an 'AND' query, meaning a password is only returned if it has all selected tags associated
with it.
</p>

<h3>6. View Current Password Value</h3>
<p>
Once password results are found and filled in the "Password(s)" table, there are multiple ways to actually
view the current password value.  The quickest is to double-click the data cell under the Password column 
of the row of the password value you want (which has ****** displayed), this will bring up a new
"Current Password" window that displays the current password value.  You can select that text and copy/paste
it as needed and click "Close" button.  You can also double-click any other data cell of the row of the password you
want which will bring up the "Password" window.  From this window to display the current password value click
the "Current Password" button which will fill the Password textbox with the current password value and click "Cancel" button.
</p>

<h4>i. View Password Permissions</h4>
<p>
Also from the Password window you may notice some features and controls are disabled or unchangable depending on the access
level of permission you have to that password.  The current permissions assigned to that password can be
viewed by clicking the "View Permissions" or "Edit Permissions" button depending on whether you have READ, WRITE, or
GRANT access to that password.
</p>

<h4>ii. View Access Audit Log</h4>
<p>
The access audit log for a password can be viewed by clicking the "View Access Audit Log" button from the Password window.
This will bring up the "Password Access Audit Log" window which shows date/time and user for each time the password
value was returned and viewed by a user (with the exception of complete data export report by administrator).  The results
can be sorted using the column header controls of the table.
</p>

<h4>iii. View Password History</h4>
<p>
The history of password values for a password can be viewed by clicking the "View Password History" button from the Password window.
This will bring up the "Password History" window which shows password value(s) (including the current one),
date/time it was created, and user who created it for each time the password value was changed. The results
can be sorted using the column header controls of the table.  You can select the text in the Password Value column and copy/paste
it as needed.
</p>

<h3>7. Update Password</h3>
<p>
If you have WRITE access to a password, you can update it by searching for and viewing the password as described above.
Once on the Password window, edit the values you want to change (Title and Username cannot be changed). 
For audit reasons you cannot "delete" a password, but instead you may "disable" it by unchecking the "Active" checkbox 
which will no longer include it in searches by default.  If you have GRANT access to a password you may also edit the
permissions by clicking the "Edit Permissions" button.  Once changes have been made, click the "Save" button.
</p>

<h3>8. Templates</h3>
<p>Reusable permission templates can be defined that bundle together commonly applied permissions to make bulk adding
of permissions to passwords faster.
</p>

<h4>i. Add Template</h4>
<p>
To add a new template into the system, click on "Password" in the main menu, then "Template", then "New".  Enter a unique
Name to identify the template, then add the appropriate permissions by using the "Select a User/Group" drop-down box and "Add" button.
Change the Access Level of permission by selecting READ/WRITE/GRANT in the row's drop-down box.  Finally decide if this template
should be shared with other users in the system (meaning they can use and edit the template, but not unshare it) by checking the 
"Shared" checkbox and click the "Save" button.
</p>

<h4>ii. Update Template</h4>
<p>
To update an existing template in the system, click on "Password" in the main menu, then "Template", then "Edit".  Choose the template
name you want to update in the Templates window and click "Okay" button or simply double-click the template name.  Now you can change
the values just as you do when adding a new template, except that you cannot unshare the template unless you are the original creator.
