  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>V. Configuration</h2>

<h3>1. encryption.properties</h3>
<p>
Edit <i>/webpasswordsafe/war/WEB-INF/encryption.properties</i> changing values specific to your encryption environment.  You absolutely should change the <b>encryptor.jasypt.password</b> value
to a new random value as this is your secret encryption key/passphrase.  It is also important it is protected properly and not changed after initial deployment, doing so will render your data unreadable.
</p>

<h3>2. jdbc.properties</h3>
<p>
Edit <i>/webpasswordsafe/war/WEB-INF/jdbc.properties</i> changing values specific to your database environment.  Commonly you'll need to change <b>jdbc.username</b> and <b>jdbc.password</b>, as well as
uncomment (remove # at beginning of line) the <b>hibernate.dialect</b>, <b>jdbc.driverClassName</b>, <b>jdbc.url</b>, <b>jdbc.validationQuery</b> lines that relate to your database server vendor and 
delete the others.  Finally change the <b>jdbc.url</b> value to point to your database server.
</p>

<h3>3. webpasswordsafe-service.xml</h3>
<p>
Edit <i>/webpasswordsafe/war/WEB-INF/webpasswordsafe-service.xml</i> to customize the plugins to fit your environment via standard Spring Framework configuration XML format.  
In all cases you will want to set the appropriate bean definition to the implementation you want (and either deleting or commenting out all other unused implementations) and
also set any other custom parameters for that implementation as needed.  See Developer Guide for how to write and integrate your own implementation of these plugins.
</p>

<h4>i. Audit Logger Plugin</h4>
<p>
This plugin is configured using the <b>bean id="auditLogger"</b> tag and can point to any class that implements the AuditLogger interface.
</p>

<h5>a. DatabaseAuditLogger</h5>
<p>
The DatabaseAuditLogger class implementation doesn't have any custom parameters to configure, it simply records all audit events into the 
audit_log table of the WebPasswordSafe database.
</p>

<h5>b. Log4jAuditLogger</h5>
<p>
The Log4jAuditLogger class implementation has one parameter "delimiter" which is the text used to separate the different audit event fields
when writing to a log.  This plugin will send all audit events to a log4j implementation category for that class.  From there log4j can be 
configured (see log4j.xml section) to write those logs to a file, console, syslog, or any other output log4j supports.
</p>

<h5>c. CompositeAuditLogger</h5>
<p>
The CompositeAuditLogger class implementation allows for the logging to multiple AuditLogger implementations at the same time.  It has one property
"auditLoggers" that can take a list of references to other beans that implement AuditLogger.  By default it sends to both DatabaseAuditLogger and
Log4jAuditLogger.
</p>

<h4>ii. Authentication Plugin</h4>
<p>
This plugin is configured using the <b>bean id="authenticator"</b> tag and can point to any class that implements the Authenticator interface.
</p>

<h5>a. LocalAuthenticator</h5>
<p>
The LocalAuthenticator class implementation is the default and authenticates users against the password setup internally for them inside of
the WebPasswordSafe application.
</p>

<h5>b. LdapAuthenticator</h5>
<p>
The LdapAuthenticator class implementation allows you to authenticate users against an LDAP server.  It takes multiple parameters and depends on
other beans.  Most often you must change the "filter" parameter based on how to find people in your LDAP schema (the $1 token will get replaced
by the username of user trying to authenticate, so that is important) and the "base" parameter is the base DN for your LDAP tree.  Furthermore,
you must configure the authnContextSource bean, setting the "url" parameter to the URL of your LDAP server, the "userDn" parameter to the DN of
the user that can bind to the LDAP server, and the "password" parameter to the password of that user that can bind to the LDAP server.
</p>

<h5>c. DemoAuthenticator</h5>
<p>
The DemoAuthenticator class implementation is used mostly just for testing or demonstration purposes.  When used it hardcodes the password of all
users to be the same value (configured by setting the "demoPassword" parameter) that cannot be changed.
</p>

<h5>d. CompositeAuthenticator</h5>
<p>
The CompositeAuthenticator class implementation allows for using multiple Authenticator implementations for different sets of users.  It takes a list
of maps that represent "authenticators".  Each map entry in the list must have an entry key "authenticator" that references another Authenticator bean.
Each map entry must also have either an entry key "users" and/or "anyUser".  The "users" entry itself contains a list of string values, one value tag
for each username that should be authenticated using this plugin entry.  The "anyUser" entry contains a boolean value "true"/"false" that if true will
attempt to authenticate any user.  The plugins are attempted in the order they are listed.  The example contained in the default configuration shows
that the admin user gets authenticated with the localAuthenticator implementation, while all other users get authenticated with the ldapAuthenticator
implementation.
</p>

<h5>e. RsaSecurIdAuthenticator</h5>
<p>
The RsaSecurIdAuthenticator class implementation is an optional Authenticator implementation (see Developer Guide) that authenticates against an
RSA SecurID server for multi-factor authentication.  Since RSA SecurID has its own configuration file for setup, this plugin simply has on parameter
"configPath" that contains the full directory and file path to the rsa_api.properties file that defines that setup.
</p>

<h4>iii. Role Retriever Plugin</h4>
<p>
This plugin is configured using the <b>bean id="roleRetriever"</b> tag and can point to any class that implements the RoleRetriever interface.
</p>

<h5>a. LocalRoleRetriever</h5>
<p>
The LocalRoleRetriever class implementation is the default which allows the defining of an "adminUsers" property that is a set of usernames 
(each username with its own value tag) that are given the ADMIN role.  It is inferred all users get the USER role.
</p>

<h4>iv. Authorization Plugin</h4>
<p>
This plugin is configured using the <b>bean id="authorizer"</b> tag and can point to any class that implements the Authorizer interface.
</p>

<h5>a. DefaultAuthorizer</h5>
<p>
The DefaultAuthorizer class implementation is the default and doesn't have any custom parameters.  All permissions are hardcoded inside
the plugin code using RBAC, functionality is authorized based on whether the user's role is of ADMIN or USER.
</p>

<h4>v. Password Generator Plugin</h4>
<p>
This plugin is configured using the <b>bean id="passwordGenerator"</b> tag and can point to any class that implements the PasswordGenerator interface.
</p>

<h5>a. SimpleRandomPasswordGenerator</h5>
<p>
The SimpleRandomPasswordGenerator class implementation allows for the changing of some basic parameters.  Change "passwordLength" value to length of 
passwords it should generate, "allowLowercase"/"allowUppercase"/"allowNumeric" to either "true"/"false" based on whether to include those types of characters in 
the generated password, and "specialChars" to a string which contains any other characters not included in the above sets in the generated password (i.e. "!@#$%^*()").
</p>

<h4>vi. Encryption - Digester Plugin</h4>
<p>
This plugin is configured using the <b>bean id="digester"</b> tag and can point to any class that implements the Digester interface and handles
one-way encryption of authentication passwords.
</p>

<h5>a. JasyptDigester</h5>
<p>
The JasyptDigester class implementation is the default using the Jasypt encryption library and is configured using the encryption.properties file.
</p>

<h5>b. EsapiDigester</h5>
<p>
The EsapiDigester class implementation is an optional implementation (see Developer Guide) using the OWASP-ESAPI encryption library and is configured 
using the encryption.properties and its own configuration files.  As of this release, this library is not considered production ready.
</p>

<h4>vii. Encryption - Encryptor Plugin</h4>
<p>
This plugin is configured using the <b>bean id="encryptor"</b> tag and can point to any class that implements the Encryptor interface and handles
two-way encryption of password data.
</p>

<h5>a. JasyptEncryptor</h5>
<p>
The JasyptEncryptor class implementation is the default using the Jasypt encryption library and is configured using the encryption.properties file.
</p>

<h5>b. EsapiEncryptor</h5>
<p>
The EsapiEncryptor class implementation is an optional implementation (see Developer Guide) using the OWASP-ESAPI encryption library and is configured 
using the encryption.properties and its own configuration files.  As of this release, this library is not considered production ready.
</p>

<h3>4. webservice-servlet.xml</h3>
<p>
Edit <i>/webpasswordsafe/war/WEB-INF/webservice-servlet.xml</i> changing the <b>locationUri</b> value to the public URL it will be deployed as (the part before /webservice).
</p>

<h3>5. log4j.xml</h3>
<p>
Edit <i>/webpasswordsafe/src/main/resources/log4j.xml</i> changing values to suit your environment.
</p>
<p>
If using the Log4jAuditLogger, you will want to pay special attention to the appenders defined to the Log4jAuditLogger category, by default using the auditLog 
appender, but can also use the auditSyslog appender to send logs to Syslog.  You may want to customize the "File" parameter to point the file to a different 
directory path or filename.  For Syslog you will want to change the "SyslogHost" and "Facility" parameters specific to the IP/Host and Facility of your Syslog server.
</p>
<p>
Besides audit logging, this log4j configuration file also handles debug logging of the WebPasswordSafe application itself.  You can change the "File" 
parameter of the "dailyFile" appender to point the debug log file to a different directory path or filename.  To make the logs more verbose, helpful when trying 
to debug problems, you can change the various "priority" values from "info" or "error" to "debug" or "trace" instead.  For further customization options please 
see log4j's own documentation.
</p>

<h3>6. web.xml</h3>
<p>
Edit <i>/webpasswordsafe/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</i> changing the "session-timeout" parameter to be an integer value representing the number of
minutes a server session can be idle before it timeouts and requires the user to re-authenticate.  The default is 10 minutes.
</p>

<h2>VI. Build and Deploy</h2>
<ol>
<li>From inside the /webpasswordsafe directory, execute the following Maven command:
  <ul>
   <li>mvn clean package</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy the WAR file generated in /webpasswordsafe/target/webpasswordsafe-[version].war to Java Servlet Container as WebPasswordSafe.war</li>
<li>If using LocalAuthenticator the default <b>admin</b> user login password is <b>admin</b>, login to WebPasswordSafe according to the User Guide and change that to something stronger.</li>
<li>Please see the User Guide for further setup and use of the WebPasswordSafe application, you are done!</li>
</ol>
